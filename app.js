        While silver was more commonly used in medieval times, my reasoning for this change is mainly in the form of the game design. 

        Copper currently holds little value. As why would you bring back 2,000 copper to just get less than 50 xp? Changing the game to use a silver standard makes this more reasonable while also giving more of a dungeon loot "progression."

        - Charging and closing into melee is different. Charging doubles movement speed but the defender gets to attack as well. If you decide to close into melee you cannot attack.
        - You can set spears or similar weapons against charges.
        - You need to randomly determine enemy targets when attacking in melee. This is not like missiles where you can target allies however.

        Secondly there's now "Special Abilities" or traits that you can roll for at 1st level. It is taken from "Fight On! #15", which I really liked. It was apparently first an idea from Mark Swanson's Special Abilities "in Alarums &
        Excursions #1" from 1975. Later it was refined from its original concept by David Hargrave who wrote it in "Arduin Grimoire #1" in 1977. There's a lot of very fun ideas in these charts, so I'm dropping it in.

My thought process behind this is that you need a way to keep the oil flask from breaking, making them obviously more encumbering when you haul around 10 of them in a pile.

        - Armor in S&W only goes up to Plate Mail, which gives 16 AC. This was 3 AC originally. 20 - 3 = 17. 17 - 1 = 16. (Descended to ascended AC calculation)
        - The parry mechanic is justified here because the risk of dying as a frontline fighter is high.

        Initially, I opted to nerf the parry, limiting it to one parry per round. This was because I felt the full extent of it, as written, was too powerful because RAW you could parry ALL attacks. This easily gives fighters upwards of 25+ AC with 19 AC armor and high dex. And that is WITHOUT magical armor.

        We've been using the armors from AD&D, where plate can go up to 19 AC. This unintentionally resulted in two buffs for fighters:
        
        - One from the S&W parry mechanic.
        - Another from the higher AC armors in AD&D.

        And so to balance things out I will use the parry mechanic (RAW), allowing fighters to parry any attacks they can see. Making them strong frontliners, but not too strong. 
        
        On the other end I will remove full plate and other plate variants so that the highest AC is plate mail with 16 AC, keeping it in line with the OD&D style.

        <b> Changes: </b>

        - Rebalancing fighter, better parry that includes all enemies in the facing direction. 
        - Worse armor for everyone. 9 base AC up to 16 with plate.

        Because I run a "godless" setting where magic works similarly from spellbooks between Law & Chaos, having MIND can be more justified. But this game changes constantly and I thought going back now after awhile was in general just a fun experiment.
        
        With that said, Wisdom is not totally useless. You can get some magic resist modifiers, a bonus spell, and spell fizzling shared between classes, which is always fun.

        <b> Changes: </b>

        - Added OSRIC combat
        - Split MIND into Intelligence & Wisdom
        - Changed languages to spoken languages & literacy (Intelligence) 
        - Added magic saving throw modifier (Magic Saves, Wisdom)
        - Added Spell Bonus (Wisdom)
        - Added Spell Fizzling between casters (Wisdom)
        - Added Reaction Modifiers (Charisma)
        - Added Weapon Speed Factors
        - Removed Slow weapon keyword (not needed when using Weapon Speed Factor)

        I also added a few QoL improvements on the website for both desktop and mobile. This also includes a page in remembrance of our fallen adventurers "Hall of the Dead". 

        TLDR:

        - Added Illusionist class
        - Added phases to combat rounds
        - Added Read Magic variants for spellcasters. This includes; Read Chaos Magic (Chaos Mage), Read Law Magic (Law Mage), Read Illusion Magic (Illusionist)
        - Added new weapon keyword from OSE, "slow", although only relevant during ties
        - Added "Hall of the Dead"

        - Changed the initiative description
        - Moved Weapons vs Armor to unused rules
        - Website changes on desktop and mobile

        One thing that caught my eye was using the weapon proficiencies from 1e. The rules are simple enough, you pick a weapon and you can use it just as usual. But every other weapon that you aren't proficient with is penalized. This is simple and effective in my opinion. It rewards having different weapons in the group. On the other end it might reward metagaming?
        
        The second big mechanic which is a little bit more crunchy is weapon types vs armor. There's now 3 different types of damage. Slashing, piercing and bludgeoning. 1e makes this rule very complicated, where every weapon attack has to be compared on a table depending on what armor the opponent has. Mine is more close to the optional rule in 2e but even more simple where there is only 3 types of weapon damage vs 3 types of armor.
        
        Other than that, the other changes are small and summarized below.

        TLDR:

        - Added Weapon proficiency.
        - Added Weapon Types vs. Armor.
        - Added Leaving Melee. Retreat and Fighting Withdrawal.
        - Added Movement and Missile Combat. Standing still grants the same attack as before, while if you want to move you can only up to half your movement rate and half fire rate.
        - Added Weapon keywords. 

        - Changed downtime healing to always be 1 per day. 1d3 when treated by a physician.
        - Changed initiative to d20 instead of d6.
        - Changed Barbarian surprise to be 1 in 6 for the ENTIRE party, instead of Barbarian immunity. Barb support.

        As of right now, I have only used an encumbrance system that decreases the movement of your character when overencumbered. The standard way of calculating movement is based on overall encumbrance. For example, if you're carrying more than 50% of your total etc it changes your speed.

        Instead of doing that I'm opting to use armor as the main movement ruling, less to keep track of and if you use the same armor it's easier to remember.

One big problem I've had with it has been the fact that there aren't any long-term consequences to gaining insanity, instead it sort of worked as a lite-version of HP. These new rules also fixes the dependency to have a high Mind score, which a certain Walker will be happy about. 

        Anyways, I found a much better system that is quite similar to the current one, from a Lovecraftian game called Silent Legions. This system slots in well with what I wanted to do. It rewards good long term play, planning, and good ol' risk taking. We'll see how it plays out. Read up on it on the "Insanity" tab!

        Obviously the humanoid races won't be removed. We instead talked about having them show up to be "unlocked" through play. But as of right now the only race available will be humans. Old characters that are humanoids can still be played.

        And lastly, races won't get bonuses anymore. Human characters created before this change still keeps the "+1 morale and loyalty" bonus to retainers, so don't remove this if you have this one already!

Copying spells only run you the cost of magical ink for the spell book paper and time to write it down.

Because travling can be dangerous and costly mostly in way of monsters and rations respectively. With that said, this is not a thing when you're traveling between sessions.

        To emphasize in-game decisions, characters cannot perform any actions except role play or strict travel. This includes gathering items in other locations or the like. However, things like shopping or finding retainers will be allowed. This is to filter out the more "boring" stuff and not make this into a play-by-post game, as that will eat up too much of my free time.

It's most similar to the 5e rules when put in use mechanically, but you're not encouraged to "build" the character in stages. You still can, but with added costs of time and gold to switch between leveling the classes. 
        
        It's probably not perfect and I haven't seen anyone use it in this way, but I think old school multi-classing and dual-classing is too restrictive so I opted for this amalgamation :)

        I wanted to avoid the Multiple Attacks akin to AD&D, even though I think they could be fun. Such as the table for fighters: 3/2 attacks. Meaning you can attack three times in 2 rounds. 2 attacks one round and 1 the next. Ranged weapons (shortbow) now have a rate of 2 per round. Meaning 2 attacks per round. And Heavy Crossbow has a rate of 1/2, one round for shooting and one for reloading. But it now deals 1d10 damage, the highest out of all missile weapons. I wanted to avoid the confusion to choose between movement and reloading, instead just defining it as a standard action. Darts have a rate of 3! Broken! 
        
        Note that maximum ranges are also added. There is no minimum range, it is always possible to shoot unless engaged in melee combat. A penalty would be applied beyond the maximum range  (or in the case of covers/hinderances).
