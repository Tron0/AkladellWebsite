**Duration:** 12 turns

**Casting Time:** 1 segment

**AoE:** 15' radius

This spell has three usages:

  inanimate objects can't be targeted. Attempting to do so wastes the
  missile.

- **Missile Count by Level:** Gains an additional missile every two

  by 9th level. Missiles can target one or multiple creatures.

  attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.

- **Affected creatures' attacks:** Against the caster are penalised by
  -1.

- **Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures:** The spell
  additionally prevents such creatures from attacking the caster in
  melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster
  engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the
  caster still gains the save and attack bonuses mentioned above).

#### Reversed: Protection from Good

### Blink (Alteration) - Chaos

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** 1 round/level

**Casting Time:** 1 segment

The caster vanishes and instantaneously reappears a short distance away at a random point each round.

- **Blink timing:** At the start of each round, roll 2d4. The caster blinks out of the material plane on that segment.

- **Distance:** The caster teleports 5 feet in a random direction described below, if this would place the caster inside a solid object, reroll the direction. If every direction is still solid, the caster instead teleports up to 10 feet in the same direction. If this is also blocked, the caster is trapped inside the Ethereal Plane and the spell ends.

- **Direction (1d8):** 1 North, 2 Northeast, 3 East, 4 Southeast, 5 South, 6 Southwest, 7 West, 8 Northwest.

- **Attacks vs the caster:** Any attack that resolves after the blink segment automatically misses, unless it covers both positions (e.g., fireball, breath weapon). Attacks resolving before the blink has occurred can hit normally.

- **Caster’s actions:** The caster’s actions resolve normally by initiative. If the blink occurs first, the caster must complete their declared action immediately afterward on the blink segment.

- **Restrictions:** The disorienting nature of the blink spell imposes a 25% chance of failing when casting spells, using magic items, or performing any action more complex than a physical attack.

### Infravision (Alteration) - Chaos

- **Heat tones:** Characters with infravision can see heat tones, with warm objects (such as living creatures) appearing bright, cold objects as black, and cool objects as grey.

- **Reading:** It is not possible to read in the dark with infravision, because fine detail cannot be perceived.

- **Range:** Infravision works within a limited range (60’ for monsters, unless specified otherwise in a monster’s description).

- **Disruption:** Visible light (normal or magical) and large heat sources prevent infravision from functioning.

### Phantasmal Force (Illusion) - Chaos

**Range:** 60'

**Duration:** Special

**Casting Time:** 2 segments

**AoE:** 400 sq. ft. + 100 sq. ft./level

Creates an illusion that appears real to those who perceive it:

- **Effect:** Affects a 20-foot cube per level.

- **Limitations:** The illusion can include sound but not smell, texture, or temperature.

- **Duration:** The illusion lasts until struck by an opponent—unless the spellcaster causes the illusion to react appropriately—or until the wizard ceases concentration upon the spell (due to desire, moving, or a successful attack that causes damage)

## <span id="spells#chaos-level-4"> 4th Level Chaos Spells </span>

### Dig (Evocation) - Chaos

**Range:** 90'

**Duration:** 1 round/level 

**Casting TIme:** 4 segments

**AoE:** 5' cube/level

Excavates earth with shocking speed, hurling spoil to the edges and forming a pit or trench where the caster directs.

- **Rate:** Each round, the spell removes one 5'x5'x5' cube of dirt, sand, or mud (125 ft³). The caster may expand the same hole or start a new, contiguous cavity each round. The caster chooses the squares affected each round; pits, trenches, and ramps are possible, provided removed material has somewhere to go.

- **Creatures directly above: **If cast beneath a creature, it falls in—no saving throw.

- **Creatures at the rim: **Any creature at the edge of the area must make a Dexterity check or fall. 

- **Rushing into the area:** A creature moving toward the newly opened pit in the first round must Save vs Spells or fall. 

- **Collapse risk:** If the pit is dug deeper than 5', there is a 25% chance per round the sides collapse, modified by material (e.g., higher in sand or mud). Creatures in the pit when it collapses should Save vs Death to avoid being buried; success scrambles out to the edge.

- **Tunneling:** Horizontal excavation is possible only if spoil can be ejected; consider doubling collapse chances unless shored.

### Enchanted Weapon (Alteration) - Chaos

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** 5 rounds/level 

**Casting Time:** 1 turn

- **Limitations:** Does not stack with other magical properties and does not grant a to-hit or damage bonuses. It only enables striking as a magical weapon.

#### Reverse: Disenchant Weapon - Chaos

### Fire Shield (Evocation) - Chaos

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** 2 rounds + 1 round/level

**Casting Time:** 4 segments

Wreaths the caster in protective flames chosen at casting—Cold Flame or Hot Flame—which guard against one energy and leave the opposite as a risk. Choose one at casting:

- **Cold Flame vs fire:** Cold flame grants the magic user a +2 bonus on any saving throw vs fire damage, also guaranteeing half damage (or no damage against all fire attacks that allow a saving throw for half damage) provided the saving throw is successful. If the caster fails a saving throw against a cold based attack, however, he or she will suffer twice the normal damage.

- **Hot Flame vs cold:** Hot flame offers the converse of the protections afforded by cold flame. Cold based attacks receive a bonus of +2 on saving throws and guarantee that the caster receives only half damage (or none at all) if his or her saving throw is successful against attacks that would cause full or half damage.

### Hallucinatory Terrain (Illusion) - Chaos

**Range:** 240’

- **Location:** The wall must be supported (e.g. by the ground) and cannot be created in an area occupied by objects.

- **Monsters with fewer than 4 HD:** Cannot pass the wall of ice.

- **Monsters with 4 or more HD:** Can break through through the wall, but suffer 1d6 damage. Fire-based creatures (e.g. flame salamanders) suffer double damage.

- **Skeletons:** Have AC 7 [12] and HD equal to those the creature had in life.

- **Zombies:** Have AC 8 [11] and HD one greater than the creature had in life.

- **Classed characters:** If a PC or NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th level fighter would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a zombie).

### Dismissal (Abjuration) - Chaos

**Duration:** Permanent

**Range:** 30’

**Casting Time:** 1 round

Attempts to send one extraplanar creature back to its home plane:

- **Resistance & save:** If the target is unwilling the creature makes a Save vs Spells. The caster's level is compared to the creature's level or Hit Dice. If the caster's level is higher, the difference is subtracted from the creature's die roll for its saving throw vs. spell. If the creature's level or Hit Dice is higher, the difference is added to the saving throw roll. 

- **Mishap:** On a successful dismissal, there is a 20% chance the subject is sent to a different plane instead. 

#### Reverse: Beckon

Attempts to conjure a creature from another plane. The type of creature, and the true name (if any), must be spoken.

- **Magic resistance:** Is checked only if the creature has no true name. The creature's saving throw is determined as in the dismissal spell. If the creature fails its save, it is immediately transported to the spellcaster's location. 

- **Restrictions:** This does not guarantee that the creature will be friendly to the spellcaster, nor does the spell caster have any form of control over the creature.

### Contingency (Evocation) - Chaos

**Range:** Touch

**Duration:** Indefinite

**Casting Time:** 1 turn

This spell allows the caster to predefine a conditional trigger for another spell to be cast instantly and automatically when specific circumstances are met. Both the Contingency spell and the contingent spell are cast simultaneously, consuming spell slots for both.

- **Trigger Conditions:** The trigger must be clear, specific, and based on perceivable events. Examples include: "When I fall to 10 hit points or fewer," "If I am attacked by a fire-breathing creature," or "When I am struck by a melee weapon."

**Range:** Caster

**Duration:** Special

**Casting Time:** 1 segment

This spell creates a 4-inch-diameter sphere in the caster's hand, which can be hurled at a target up to 90' away.
