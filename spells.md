- **Affected creatures' attacks:** Against the caster are penalised by
  -1.

- **Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures:** The spell

  caster still gains the save and attack bonuses mentioned above).

#### Reversed: Protection from Good

This spell allows the caster to predefine a conditional trigger for another spell to be cast instantly and automatically when specific circumstances are met. Both the Contingency spell and the contingent spell are cast simultaneously, consuming spell slots for both.

advance toward the caster and await his or her bidding. 

- **Communication:** The caster can communicate with the creature in a crude fashion, telling it to go to a certain place, but directions must be simple. The spell caster can attach some small item or note to the creature. If so instructed, the creature will then wait at that location until the duration of the spell expires. (Note that unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a creature, the carrier may be ignored.)
