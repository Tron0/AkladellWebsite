# Races

Races do not have ability score requirements. You can be a dwarf with 8
constitution or a halfling with 18 strength. There are no class
restrictions for specific races. As long as you fulfill the ability
requirements for the class, any race can be any class.

# <span id=Weapons-vs-Armor> Weapon Types vs. Armor </span>

The table below describes an approach to weapon and armor interactions. Different damage types influence the To-Hit modifier from attacks. Either positive, negative, or neutral.

| **Armor Type**  | **Slashing**  | **Piercing**  | **Bludgeoning**  |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Light           | +1            | +0            | -1               |

# <span id=Mana-System> Mana System </span>

## Spell Points

Instead of gaining spell slots to cast your spells from, you gain a pool
of spell points (referred to as **Mana**). The amount of mana you spend
is based on the level of the spell being cast, and you can't reduce your
mana pool to less than 0. You recover all spent mana when you finish a
rest, at least 6 hours. You spend mana equal to the level of spell being
cast. For example, a 1st-level spell spends 1 mana, a 9th-level spell
spends 9 mana.

The amount of mana available to spend is based on your level as a
spellcaster, as shown in the Mana Progression table below. Your level
and spellcasting attribute (wisdom/intelligence) also determines the maximum level spell you can
cast. Even though you might have enough mana to cast a spell above this
maximum, you can't do so.

## Common Magic

Spells of 1st- to 5th-level are referred to as Common magic. Common
magic spells can be cast repeatedly while enough mana remain available
to spend. For example, if you have 7 mana and can cast 2nd-level spells,
you can cast seven 1st-level spells, five 1st-level spells and one
2nd-level spells, three 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells, or
one 1st-level spell and three 2nd-level spells.

## High Magic

Spells of 6th level and higher are referred to as High magic. High magic
spells are particularly powerful. You are limited to how many high magic
spells you can cast before needing to finish a rest to cast more. The
number of high magic spells you can cast is equal to your maximum level
spell minus 5. For example, if you can cast 7th-level spells, 6th- and
7th-level spells are high magic. You can cast (7th – 5 = 2) two high
magic spells before needing a rest to recover them. They can be two
6th-level spells (total 12 mana), or one 6th- and one 7th-level spell
(total 13 mana), or two 7th-level spells (total 14 mana).

### Mana Pool

In this system, each mana point in your pool corresponds to a specific
color. For example, a 4th-level cleric with 12 mana could allocate these
points as follows: 3W, 2U, 2B, 5G. Spells require mana of their assigned
color. For instance, a 13th-level sorcerer casting 'Etherealness' (a
Blue spell) as a 7th-level spell would spend 7 Blue mana. Mana from
other colors cannot be used.

### Devoting Mana to Colors

After a day's rest, you can redistribute your mana across the colors as
needed. For example, a 4th-level Law Mage with 12 mana may allocate the
points as 3W, 2U, 2B, 5G expecting to cast healing spells (Green)
frequently. After the next rest, the Law Mage could adjust this to 1W,
1U, 1B, and 2G based on the group's need.

## <span id=Starting-Gold> Starting Gold </span>

| **Class**  | **Starting Gold Pieces (x10)** |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Fighter    | 5d4 (50-200)                   |
| Specialist | 2d6 (20-120)                   |
| Law Mage   | 3d6 (30-180)                   |
| Chaos Mage | 2d4 (20-80)                    |
| Barbarian  | 2d6 (20-120)                   |

# <span id=Insanity> Insanity </span>

When a character faces events of bloodshed or unspeakable horror, a saving throw is made. Failing this saving throw will cause damage to the character's psyche, tracked as insanity points. 

Insanity starts at a score of 0 unless specified otherwise. If a character's insanity ever exceeds their maximum threshold, they are permanently retired from play. The total insanity threshold of a character is 90 + Intelligence. Insanity cannot be healed naturally. 

Insanity may only be reduced in one of two ways: 
- Upon gaining a level, reduce Insanity by 10 points. 
- Take on a random Affliction to reduce Insanity by 10 points. This can be dangerous.

Afflictions can only be cured by specific spells or by spending gold to seek an attempt at healing during downtime. If a character ever acquires 3 or more Afflictions, that character is permanently retired.

# <span id=Multiclassing> Multiclassing (old) </span>

Multiclassing is the ability to switch classes and begin advancing in a
new class in addition to the old one. To be eligible for multiclassing
the character needs to have an ability score of 15+ in the prime
requisite(s) of the original class, and of 17+ in the prime requisite(s)
of the new class, as well as enough experience points for an advancement
in the current class.

The character needs to spend time and gold in training for the benefits
to become a first level member of the class. All further XP is applied
to the new class. The cost of switching back to a previous one is half
of the training time and gold cost.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, they gain
the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class.
All experience is applied to progressing in the class with the highest
XP requirements in regard to the total level of the character. So a
[<u>Fighter</u>](#fighter) 2/[<u>Chaos Mage</u>](#chaos-mage) 1 would
require 10,000 XP for the second level in Chaos Magic. Even if switched
back to leveling the fighter class, they would need 20,000 XP to become
a level 3 fighter as the Chaos Mage table still applies. 

Restrictions regarding armor still apply to the character. Whereas attacks, weapons, abilities and saving throws are applied as a bonus. In the case of a choice in saving throw, the higher number of the two classes is used and not as an additive.

| **Class**  | **Cost (GP)** | **Maximum Training Time** |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Fighter    | 1,500         | 8 weeks                   |
| Inquisitor | 2,500         | 16 weeks                  |
| Specialist | 1,250         | 8 weeks                   |
| Law Mage   | 2,000         | 12 weeks                  |
| Chaos Mage | 2,500         | 16 weeks                  |
| Barbarian  | 1,500         | 8 weeks                   |

## Costs of Living

Player characters pay an amount of gold per adventure equal to 1% of their total XP. 
So for example, a 2nd level fighter that has garnered a total of 3000 XP pays 30 gold per month for the cost of adventure spending.
