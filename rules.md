## <span id=Special-Abilities> Special Abilities </span>

*Initially from "Alarums & Excursions #1" in 1975 and "Arduin Grimoire #1" in 1977, these are mostly inspired by the former. Made by Attronarch from "Fight On! #15"*

Special Abilities are more like "special traits" that can both be positive and negative. Begin by noting what type your class is associated with on the initial table and tell this to your DM. 

| **Type** | **Class** | 
|------|-------| 
| Martial | Fighter, Inquisitor, Barbarian 
| Chaos | Chaos Mage, Illusionist 
| Law | Law Mage | 
| Clandestine | Specialist |

Then roll 1d8 to determine the amount of Boons and/or Banes you start with. The DM will then roll for each and tell you exactly what kind of trait(s) your character has received.

| 1d8   | Boons | Banes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1     |   0   |     1 |
| 2     |   1   |     2 |

**Prime Attribute:** Strength, 16+ (+5% experience bonus)

**Hit Dice:** 1d10/level (Gains 3 hp/level after 9th level)

**Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any

**Weapons Permitted:** Any

**Alignment:** Inquisitors are of Lawful alignment.

**Magic Items** Inquisitors may only own no more than three magic items.

**Parry:** Inquisitors with a Dexterity score of 14 or better can fight on
the defensive, parrying enemy blows, as shown on the
table below. The Inquisitor can parry one enemy attack
without giving up the ability to attack themselves in the same round.
Parrying is not effective against ranged weapons, but is effective
against claws, bites and touch attacks.

| **Dexterity Score** | **Penalty to Enemy Attacks** |

**Hit & Damage Bonuses:** Inquisitors gain a hit and damage bonus as
seen on the strength & dexterity ability score sections.

**Saving Throw Bonuses:** Inquisitors gain a +2 to all saving throws.

**Detect Evil**: An Inquisitor can detect the presence of evil intent up
to 60 feet away by concentrating on locating evil in a particular
direction. They can do this as often as desired, but each attempt takes
one round. This ability detects evil monsters and characters.

**Disease immunity:** An Inquisitor is immune to all forms of disease.
(Note that certain magical afflictions—lycanthropy and mummy rot—are
curses and not diseases.)

**Lay on Hands:** An Inquisitor can “lay on hands” once per day to cure
others of 2 hit points of damage per level of the Inquisitor, or to cure
disease. If the other person is afflicted by more than one disease, only
one of these will be affected per five levels the Inquisitor has
attained. This functions the same way as any spell would and takes one
round to cast.

**Strong Willed:** Whenever the Inquisitor is under the effects of a
spell that incapacitates the body or mind (sleep, hold, charm,
paralysis, etc.), they may make a new saving throw every round

**Banishing Undead (3rd) :** An Inquisitor gains the power to turn
undead and fiends when they reach 3rd level. They affect these monsters
the same as does a [<u>Law Mage</u>](#law-mage) two levels lower—for
example, at 3rd level they have the turning power of a 1st-level [<u>Law
Mage</u>](#law-mage).

**Dispel Evil (8th):** : Starting at 8th level, the Inquisitor can
dispel evil once per day, as per the Law Mage spell (see the description of the [<u>Law
Mage</u>](#law-mage-1) spell dispel evil).

improve the ability in the chosen skills. For skills that are “x in 6”,
allocating a point increases the chance by one. For example, Lockpicking
begins at 1 in 6. A Specialist allocating a point to this skill
increases the chance to 2 in 6. Every class has the following skills as
a 1 in 6. A skill cannot be increased further than a 5 in 6.

**Architecture:** Clues, warning and rewards can be built into
structures of a character's surroundings. Determining if a passage
shifts or slopes gradually, detecting if a structure is unsafe to travel
in/on, as well as any history found in the structure can be noted.

**Foraging** (See Foraging)

**Lockpicking:** Specialists can pick locks with Thieves' tools; some
locks might be unusually difficult, in which case the game master might
reduce the chance as appropriate.

**Search:** Finding features of interest, hidden doors or compartments.
Note that finding secret doors does not grant the character an
understanding of how it works.

**Sleight of Hand:** Picking the pockets of an unaware person, hiding a
small object from a search, readying a weapon without any observers
noticing, swappingout an object on a weight-sensitive plate with a
similarly-weighted bag of sand, these and more are examples of Sleight
of Hand.

**Sneak Attack:** Sneak Attacks are merely attacks made by surprise. A
Specialist can multiply the damage done by a Sneak Attack by allocating
points to this skill. Assume that the damage multiplier is x1 for all
characters, but for every point allocated to the skill by a Specialist,
the damage multiplier is increased by one. If a Specialist has any
points in Sneak Attack, then they also get a +2 bonus to hit above any
other bonuses they already have when performing a Sneak Attack.

**Stealth:** Stealth allows a character to sneak around and hide. In
order to use the Stealth skill, those that the character wishes to hide
from must not already be aware of the character's presence, and there
must be somewhere to hide. If a character attacks after successfully
using Stealth, that attack greatly increases the chance of a
[<u>Surprise</u>](#surprise) attack, even if the enemy is already
engaged in battle.

**Tinker:** Disarming traps, disabling pressure plates, manipulating
small impromptu devices or even creating objects from mechanical parts
would be considered Tinkering.

\*Minimum is the least amount of spells learned at character creation
from the selected roster of spells. If the amount isn't met when rolling
through the list, simply repeat until it is. Maximum is simply the limit
to how many spells are known at character creation.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Law Mages gain a +2 bonus on saving throws
against being paralyzed or poisoned.

**Known Spells:** Law Mages initially have access to five 1st-level
spells as well as “Read Law Magic”, a first level blue spell. Refer to the
spell table above to identify how many of the five spells are already
inscribed and comprehended in the spellbook. Any remaining spells out of
the initial ten, which are not yet understood, are not added to the
spellbook until the Mage has successfully learned the initial set.

**Banishing Undead:** Law Mages can Turn Undead as seen below. If the number on the dice is equal to or greater than the number shown
on the table, 2d6 creatures of the targeted type are turned and depart.

Law (Spellcasting) and Chaos (Spellcasting)

# <span id=Alignment> Alignment </span> 

Alignments are Law, Chaos, and Neutral. Law and Chaos are terms used to
refer to the underlying workings within the universe and the world, not
on behavior or ethics. Law is associated with Lawful Magic, Chaos is
associated with Chaos Magic. Characters who do not practice magic are
neutral in the theory of alignment.

## Magical Language

Alignment languages (Law and Chaos) are used to cast spells from the
warp; spellcasters borrow words of power which channels into magic for
them to use. “Clerical magic” is now changed to Lawful Magic, to
contrast with conventional Mage lists which is Chaos Magic. Magic Users
are either [<u>Chaos Mages</u>](#chaos-mage) or [<u>Law
Mages.</u>](#law-mage)

# <span id=General-Gameplay> General Gameplay </span>

**The following mechanics are changed or specially noted.**

## Experience Points

XP is earned solely through the acquisition of gold. For each Gold Piece (GP) safely collected, players will earn 1 XP. All experience is shared between the party.

## Costs of Living

Player characters pay an amount of gold per month equal to 1% of their total XP. So for example, a 2nd level fighter that has garnered a total of 3000 XP pays 30 gold per month for the cost of living during a month of downtime.

# <span id=Spellcasting> Spellcasting </span>

## Learning Spells

All mages possess a spellbook from which they learn and mentally prepare
spells. This spell also contains “Read Magic” , a first level blue
spell. As they progress in level, mages may encounter or research new
spells which they can add to their spellbook. Not all spells can be
learned instantaneously – the complexity of a spell and the mage's
current level affect their ability to comprehend and learn new magic.
When gaining a new level, a spellcaster may reroll previously not
[<u>understood</u>](#Intelligence) spells from their spellbook.

## <span id=Spell-Copying> Spell Copying </span>

Copying spells from a scroll runs the cost of an essential magical ink 
that is suited for the spell book at hand. After successfully understanding 
a spell, the mage may decide to rewrite the spell in the book. This costs 100
GP worth of ink and one day of downtime per spell level. A lightning bolt in
this case would cost 300 gold and three days' worth of downtime.

## Innate Magic

There are some exceptions to the typical rules of spellcasting. Certain
beings might be born with innate magical powers, such as the Dwarves.
For these unique cases, spellcasting might not adhere to the same rules
as described above. Always consult the specific race or class
descriptions for these unique magical users.

## <span id=Memorizing-Spells> Memorizing Spells </span>

Mages can hold only a certain quantity of magical power in
mental, memorized reserve to be released later in the form of a spell.
Indeed, it is the first warning taught to apprentice mages: that to successfully memorize a 
spell beyond one’s training and mental powers
is the last action one will ever take as a sane human being. The mind
will be utterly broken, and the vitriol of Chaos will seep into that
broken vessel (if the fool is even left alive), turning the mindless husk
into a thing far less, and far worse, than human.

Some **spells beyond 6th level** are treated as magical projects that would require casting in a proper space.
They require research, experimentation, training, and perhaps even ingredients to cast.

# <span id=Combat> Combat </span>

## Order of Combat

1. Determine Surprise (d6)
2. Declare Spells and Melee actions (Fighting Retreat, Charge, Parry etc)
3. Determine Initiative (d6)
4. Winning side acts:
  - Movement
  - Spells/Abilities
  - Missile attacks
  - Melee attacks
5. Other sides act: In initiative order.
6. Spells with casting time of 1 round are cast.



## Initiative

After any surprise segments are resolved and actions are declared, the first combat round begins. At the beginning of a combat round, each side rolls initiative on a d6. The roll represents the six second segment of the round in which the OTHER group will be able to act; hence, the higher roll is the better roll (as the other party will act later). If the party rolls a 6 for initiative, and the monsters roll a 1, this means that the party will be acting in segment 1, and the monsters will not act until the sixth segment of the 10-segment round. Since a combat round is 10 segments long, and the initiative roll only covers the first six segments of the round, there are four remaining segments in the round after the two sides have already taken their actions: these remaining four segments are still important because spells may take effect during this time, and some combatants might “hold” (choose to delay) their actions, waiting to act until these later segments. 

## Armor Class

A character's Armor Class (AC) represents their ability to avoid being
hit in combat, starting with a base of 10 and potentially increasing
with factors such as worn armor, carried shields, and
[<u>Dexterity</u>](#dexterity) modifiers. To successfully strike a
target, the final result must equal or surpass the defender's AC.

## Surprise
<img src="./media/image1.jpg" style="width:3.36027in;height:2.83134in" />

Surprise is checked only once per combat, at the beginning of an encounter. Each side rolls a d6. If the result is a 1, the group is surprised for one segment. If the result is a 2, the group is surprised for two segments. If the result is a 3-6, the group is not surprised. In some cases, monsters or particular character classes may have special rules for surprise (e.g. some monsters cannot be surprised, others are stealthy enough that the party may be surprised on a roll of higher than 2). If a party of adventurers has alerted monsters to its presence (by hammering away at a door for a round or two, for example), the monsters will not need to make a surprise roll at all; however, merely being alert to the possibility of danger is not enough to avoid making a surprise roll. If neither of the opposing forces is surprised, play moves on to the regular combat round. 

## Critical Hits

Rolling a 20 on a d20 attack roll is called a “critical hit”. This guarantees that the character's attack hits the target, regardless of the target's Armor Class (AC). However, it does not double the damage or dice. Similarly, rolling a 1 means the attack automatically fails, regardless of the target's AC. This is also applied to saving throws and works in the same way.

## <span id=Combat-Actions> Combat Actions </span>

### Melee Attack

A melee attack is an attack with a hand-held weapon such as a sword, halberd, or dagger. A character's strength bonuses "to hit" and on damage are added to melee attacks. It is only possible to make a melee attack when the two combatants are within 10-ft of each other. Two combatants within 10-ft of each other are considered to be "engaged." When faced with more than one opponent, it is not possible to pick which opponent will be the one receiving the attack; in the rapid give and take of melee, any one of the opponents might be the one to let down his guard for a moment. 

When a character is in melee with multiple opponents, the target of an attack roll must be determined randomly, but note that characters or creatures with multiple attacks that are part of the same routine (such as a character wielding a sword and dagger) must make all attacks against the same opponent.

### Closing into Combat

When two groups of combatants are not within the 10-ft melee range, the attackers may choose either to charge into combat or to advance more cautiously, closing into combat. Closing into combat does not allow the character to make an attack roll that round; the cautious advance does not generate the opening to make a significant attack. However, neither may the character's opponent attack until the round after closing. When closing into combat, the character may advance the full amount of his or her movement. 

### Charge

Charging into combat allows the attacker to move and then attack in the same round. A charge is made at twice the normal movement rate (and must terminate within the 10-ft melee range of the target). If the defender has a longer weapon than the attacker, the defender attacks first (unless the defender has already acted in this round). The attacker gains no dexterity bonus against such an attack (and characters with no dexterity bonus receive a -1 AC penalty). Additionally, if the defender has a weapon set against the charge (see below), he or she will inflict additional damage with a successful hit against the charging attacker. 

Assuming that the charging character survives, he or she gains +2 “to hit” on his or her attack. Characters may only perform a charge once every 10 rounds (i.e. once per turn). Characters who are at the maximum encumbrance category may not charge unless they are mounted and the mount is below the maximum encumbrance category. 

### Parrying

A character who parries cannot move for the duration of the combat round. See [<u>Fighter Parry</u>](#Fighter)

### Set Weapon Against Charge 

Certain weapons can be “set” against a charge, which is a simple matter of bracing the weapon against the floor or some other stationary object. A character choosing to set his or her weapon against a charge cannot attack unless an opponent charges, but the weapon will inflict double damage against a charging opponent. A charge is any attack that allows the attacker to move and attack, and thus includes leaping attacks that may be made by some monsters. 

Weapons that may be set against a charge include spears, lances (when used dismounted), most pole arms, and tridents. 

### <span id=Leaving-Melee> Leaving Melee </span>

Where two or more creatures are engaged in a melee, either may break off from the engagement during their turn. The creature leaving the melee has two choices:

- **Retreating:** You spend an action to run away and forfeit your shield bonus. You may retreat up to your movement. Doing so allows the opponent a free attack with an added +2 To-Hit once during the round (this is not an action however so multiple attacks do not apply).

- **Fighting Withdrawal:** A Fighting Withdrawal may be used in combat if the defender wants to backup slowly. Movement backwards is limited to ½ the normal movement per round (or less). This manoeuvre may be used to “switch places” with another party member who is in combat, the first party member joining battle with the enemy to prevent the enemy's pursuit while the second character makes a fighting retreat. 

## Two-Weapon Fighting and Two-Handed Weapons

Just as shields improve armor class by 1, fighting two-handed grants a
+1 to damage rolls (except for weapons that can only be used two-handed,
where this is already taken into account in the weapon's damage), and
fighting with a weapon in each hand gives a +1 to hit. Note that
fighting with two weapons does not actually give two separate attacks;
it just increases the likelihood of landing a successful blow.

## <span id=Missile-and-Missile-Combat> Movement and Missile Combat </span>

A character can move up to one-half his normal movement rate and engage in missile fire at half his normal rate of fire. Thus, a man capable of moving 120 feet and armed with a long bow (two shots per round, under normal circumstances) could move 60 feet and still fire one shot. 
The same man, armed with a heavy crossbow (one shot every other round) would be able to shoot only once every four rounds while on the move.

## <span id=Weapon-Proficiencies> Weapon Proficiencies </span>

Weapon proficiencies determine which weapons a player character can use effectively. Characters gain an initial amount of proficiency slots based on their class and can allocate these slots to different weapons. Each slot allows the character to use a specific weapon without penalties. More slots mean more weapons can be used proficiently. When a character chooses a proficiency, it is assumed that he had been studying it in his spare time and once a proficiency slot is filled, it can never be changed or reassigned. 

If a character is not proficient when using a weapon, a penalty modifier is applied to the To-Hit roll. However, it is assumed that some skill is transfered within categories. If a character uses a weapon within the same category but is not proficient with it, the penality is halved to a minimum of -1.  Note the table below.

| **Class**  | **To-Hit Penalty** |
|------------|--------------------|
| Fighter*   | -2                 |
| Specialist | -3                 | 
| Law Mage   | -3                 | 
| Chaos Mage | -5                 | 
| Barbarian  | -2                 | 

*Includes Inquisitors

# <span id=Injury-&-Death> Injury and Death </span>

When a character (or creature) is hit, the amount of damage is deducted
from hit points (hp). When the total hit points reaches 0, the character
is unconscious, and if their hp are brought down to -10 or lower, the
character dies. An unconscious character bleeds continuously without aid
from others, at a rate of 1 hp/round until death at -10.

All characters regain 1 hp for each day of rest. Additionally, 
being treated by a physician would add an 1d3
extra hp per day. Characters that have been knocked unconscious from the
result of combat need to rest for at least five days, or until their hp
is back to full to be able to function in a fight again.

# <span id=Creature-Size> Creature Size </span>

Medium sized creatures can use Large (L) weapons with both hands; Small
(S) or Medium (M) weapons with one hand. Smaller creatures like goblins
can't use Large weapons. Must wield Medium weapons with both hands. The
specifics of each creature size is in the [<u>Races</u>](#_ixtrbw17tt3h)
chapter.

# <span id=Time> Time </span>

## Travel Time

Distance traveled per day is based on base movement rates, modified by
terrain and encumbrance. A party can usually navigate 2 hexes (12 miles
or 20 km) on foot over flat clear land per day. (6 miles or 10 km on
rougher terrain)

Forced marches at higher speeds are possible but require a [<u>minor
Strength test</u>](#strength) to avoid exhaustion.

## Dungeon Time

Delving into dungeons is measured in turns, equal to 10 minutes of
in-game time. Most actions like searching, spell durations, and ambushes
happen in turn increments.

Light sources like torches and lanterns burn for a specific number of
turns before being consumed. Spells are timed in turns. Events,
wandering monsters, and resting also transpire in turn units. Important
decisions are also considered turn by turn. For example, lockpicking a
door or checking for traps. Some other actions like searching a room can
both be a simple noted action or described in detail by players, if
described then it won't cost a turn most of the time.

## Combat Time

Combat occurs in rounds, with each round lasting 10 seconds of in-game
time. Turn structure defines the sequence of actions and events during a
round.

Spell casting times are measured in rounds, and spell effects often last
a certain number of rounds.

# <span id=Insanity> Insanity </span>

When a character faces events of bloodshed or unspeakable horror, a saving throw is made. Failing this saving throw will cause damage to the character's psyche, tracked as insanity points. 

Insanity starts at a score of 0 unless specified otherwise. If a character's insanity ever exceeds their maximum threshold, they are permanently retired from play. The total insanity threshold of a character is 90 + Intelligence. Insanity cannot be healed naturally. 

Insanity may only be reduced in one of two ways: 
- Upon gaining a level, reduce Insanity by 10 points. 
- Take on a random Affliction to reduce Insanity by 10 points. This can be dangerous.

Afflictions can only be cured by specific spells or by spending gold to seek an attempt at healing during downtime. If a character ever acquires 3 or more Afflictions, that character is permanently retired.

# <span id=Retainers> Retainers </span>

Followers of any kind are separated in two categories, Henchmen and
Hirelings.

## Henchmen

Henchmen are leveled and classed followers that are willing to delve into dungeons and fight alongside the player characters. They are both meant as a suitable backup incase of sudden demise of the player character where the player can continue on as them, as well as offering a helping hand in combat scenarios. Henchmen (and hirelings) are individuals with different goals and personalities, and can act both in a helping manner and sometimes against the wishes of the PC. 

Henchmen need to be given suitable equipment and half a share of treasure after any successful heist, or else risk their departure. Their loyalty is dependent on the [<u>Charisma</u>](#Charisma) score of the PC they work for. And because Henchmen act similar to a normal PC, morale is not taken into account, but loyalty checks might be rolled in case of questionable or dangerous commands given to them. Henchmen also gain XP as a PC would.

Hiring Henchmen

| **Method**      | **Cost** |
|-----------------|----------|
| Hiring a crier  | 10 GP    |
| Posting notices | 50 GP    |
| Hiring agents   | 300 GP   |

## Hirelings

Hirelings are specialized NPCs that provide services for the party.
Anything from laborers to torch bearers fit in this category. Hirelings
can be fighters as well, such as mercenaries or soldiers, but they never
gain XP or levels. They expect a salary as any worker would, which
obviously depends on what their profession is. Which in the case of
mercenaries could be a flat cost for a trip into a dungeon, or if
traveling for longer might be a day-to-day salary. This completely
depends on the situation of the job. Hirelings given a work opportunity
in advance do not require rations or similar if they get extra payment.

# <span id=Encumbrance-&-Movement> Encumbrance & Movement </span>

Characters have a total number of slots (or unique items carried) equal
to their Strength Score. Each item carried takes up one slot unless
noted otherwise. Some items such as torches, bandages, or daggers are
stackable. Meaning that multiple of the same type can be carried (up to
10). Mundane items that are small enough to fit in your hand do not
require a slot. On the other hand, items that require two hands take up
two slots. Coins are treated as mundane until a hundred of any type are
carried. After which they take up one slot per a hundred coins. Mundane
clothing does not count towards encumbrance.

Player characters can carry items such as backpacks, sacks and belts
which can function as containers for other smaller items. These items
and their contents should be labeled accordingly in case the character
loses the container. Generally, all containers that are in use and worn
etc, does not count towards the total encumbrance.

Three slots should be labled as the “quick draw” slots. Items stored in
these can be taken out during combat without the use of an action. Any
other item requires an action to be taken out from the inventory. The
exception would be stackable items, multiple items of the same type such
as potions cannot be automatically replaced after they've been used in
the quick draw slots. But mundane items can be replaced, like rocks or
gold inside of a pouch.

# Movement Speed

| **Armor**                     | **Base Movement Speed** |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Unarmored                     | 150' EX (50' EN)        |
| Light Armor                   | 120' EX (40' EN)         |
| Medium Armor                  | 90' EX (30' EN)         |
| Heavy Armor                   | 60' EX (20' EN)         |

## Overencumbrance

| **Unique Items Carried**    | **Movement Speed Decrease** |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Equal or under Strength Score | -0 EX (0' EN)                  |
| Strength Score + 1 Item       | -30' EX (10' EN)                     |
| Strength Score + 2 Items      | -60' EX (20' EN)                    |
| Strength Score + 3 Items      | -90' EX (30' EN)                    |

*For example, a character with a Strength of 16 would be able to carry
16 unique items and have a movement rate of 120 EX while unarmored. If that character
carried 18 items, their base movement rate would be 60 EX.*

## Indoor, Underground & City Movement

**Exploring the unknown:** When exploring unknown areas of a dungeon, characters can move their base movement rate in feet per turn. This very slow rate of movement accounts for PCs exploring in a dark, unknown environment, moving carefully and stealthily, and mapping their progress. 

**In familiar areas:** When PCs are moving through dungeon areas with which they are familiar, the referee may allow them to move at a faster rate. For example, the referee might allow PCs to move at three times their base movement rate per turn, when moving through familiar areas. 

## Outdoor Movement

|**Description** | **Speed** |
|----------------|-----------|
| Hiking         | Base exploration movement rate in miles/day No forced march checks required| Base exploration movement rate in miles/day No forced march checks required |
| Forced March   | Double exploration movement rate in miles/day Forced march checks required once per day (4d6 vs. strength) to continue at this pace. |

## Foraging

Characters journeying through the wilderness have the option to forage
or hunt for food, either to supplement their existing supplies or stave
off hunger. Food foraging can be done even while traveling.

[<u>Specialists</u>](#specialist) are the only class able to improve the
chances of foraging. Refer to the [<u>Specialist Skills</u>](#skills)
and use that chance for each character's roll. The Specialist is
regarded as the “scouting leader” when foraging. A successful day of
foraging provides a day's worth of rations. The foraged food will likely
be a combination of nuts, berries, and possibly small game.

If characters wish to hunt, they must dedicate a whole day to the task,
during which they can't travel. Again, use the character with the
highest foraging [<u>skill</u>](#skills). If successful, the DM will
roll an additional encounter from the Animal Subtable found in the
Wilderness Wandering Monster Tables. This encounter is separate from any
regular encounter rolls for the day. It's important to note that hunting
cannot occur during days allocated for resting.

# <span id=Multiclassing> Multiclassing </span>

Multiclassing is the ability to switch classes and begin advancing in a
new class in addition to the old one. To be eligible for multiclassing
the character needs to have an ability score of 15+ in the prime
requisite(s) of the original class, and of 17+ in the prime requisite(s)
of the new class, as well as enough experience points for an advancement
in the current class.

The character needs to spend time and gold in training for the benefits
to become a first level member of the class. All further XP is applied
to the new class. The cost of switching back to a previous one is half
of the training time and gold cost.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, they gain
the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class.
All experience is applied to progressing in the class with the highest
XP requirements in regard to the total level of the character. So a
[<u>Fighter</u>](#fighter) 2/[<u>Chaos Mage</u>](#chaos-mage) 1 would
require 10,000 XP for the second level in Chaos Magic. Even if switched
back to leveling the fighter class, they would need 20,000 XP to become
a level 3 fighter as the Chaos Mage table still applies. 

Restrictions regarding armor still apply to the character. Whereas attacks, weapons, abilities and saving throws are applied as a bonus. In the case of a choice in saving throw, the higher number of the two classes is used and not as an additive.

| **Class**  | **Cost (GP)** | **Maximum Training Time** |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Fighter    | 1,500         | 8 weeks                   |
| Inquisitor | 2,500         | 16 weeks                  |
| Specialist | 1,250         | 8 weeks                   |
| Law Mage   | 2,000         | 12 weeks                  |
| Chaos Mage | 2,500         | 16 weeks                  |
| Barbarian  | 1,500         | 8 weeks                   |





# <span id=Psionics> Psionics </span>

Every character with a high enough Intelligence and or Charisma gets to roll to
see if they possess Intelligence powers known as psionics. The table columns are
cumulative. A character with a score of 18 in both abilities would have
a 12% chance of being psionic. Any number of powers available can be
used in combination each day.

Consult the following table:

| **Ability Score** | **% for Intelligence** | **% for Charisma** | **Amount of Powers** |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 15                | 1.5%           | 1.5%               | 1d3                  |
| 16                | 3%             | 3%                 | 1d4                  |
| 17                | 4.5%           | 4.5%               | 1d6                  |
| 18                | 6%             | 6%                 | 1d8                  |

character's “Amount of Powers” as seen earlier. Reroll any duplicate
numbers.

## Psionic Powers

### Army of One

**Range: Self**

**Duration: 1 round**

The user becomes a peerless warrior, able to move in battle with inhuman
reflexes in order to attack enemies within immediate melee range. The
user is able to make one melee attack for every opponent already
engaging them. Each attack must be against a different opponent, and the
extra attacks are not gained if the user must move to engage a foe.

### Clairaudience

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 2 hours**

The user can hear through solid obstacles. A 2' thickness of stone
blocks the effect, as does the thinnest layer of lead.

### Clairvoyance

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 2 hours.**

The user can see through solid obstacles. A 2' thickness of stone blocks
the effect, as does the thinnest layer of lead.

### ESP

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 2 hours.**

The user can detect the thoughts of other beings. A 2' thickness of
stone blocks the effect, as does the thinnest layer of lead.

### Mental Barrier

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 1 round**

When activated, any attack against a creature with this power recieve a
-5 penalty to their attack roll for the duration.

### Mental Blast

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 1 round**

This attack of pure mental energy causes 3d8 damage on a target.
Intelligent creatures can save vs. magic to avoid the damage. Other
creatures possessing psionic powers gain a +5 on the save.

### Mind Control

**Range: 120'**

**Duration: Special**

The unfortunate victim of this power falls under the user's influence.
This psionic power can work on any intelligent creature for as long as
the user intensely concentrates (no fighting or even walking). A saving
throw vs magic negates the effect. Animals are immune, as are the Old
Ones.

### Precognition

**Range: Self**

**Duration: 1 round**

This allows the user to tell what will happen to only themselves if they
were to do something. No more than 1 minute into the future can be seen.

### Sleep

**Range: 60'**

**Duration: 1d4 hours**

Affects up to 1d4 Hit Dice of creatures within 60 feet to sleep. Least Hit Dice creatures affected first and those with 4+3 Hit Dice and above remain unaffected. 

Creatures can save vs. magic to avoid this effect. Otherwise they are unconscious for 1d4 hours unless awoken. 

Some beings such as undead are immune to this effect as they would be with magic.



### Suspend Life

**Range: Self**

**Duration: Special**

A being with this power may place themselves into a trance that nears
suspended animation. They feel the passage of one day for every 10 years
that actually pass. Though on a slower schedule, the being grows hungry
after a “day” without food (though 10 years pass in actuality) and
begins to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as appropriate. It
takes four rounds to draw oneself out of this trance.

### Telekinesis

**Range: 120'**

**Duration: 1 hour**

The user can move objects using mental power alone. The amount of weight
they can lift and move is 20 pounds per level.

### Telepathy

**Range: 120'**

**Duration: 1 turn**

Direct mind-to-mind communication with intelligent beings, transcending
language. Telepathic contact with an Old One is foolish, and the Referee
will most likely require a saving throw to avoid madness and/or horror.

  upon an object, in which case the light moves with the object.

- **Blinding a creature:** By casting the spell upon its eyes. If the
  target fails a saving throw versus spells, it is blinded for the
  duration. A blind creature's attack modifier, save, and AC is reduced by 4.

- **Cancelling darkness:** Light may cancel a darkness spell.

### Reversed: Darkness

# <span id=Weapons-vs-Armor> Weapon Types vs. Armor </span>

The table below describes an approach to weapon and armor interactions. Different damage types influence the To-Hit modifier from attacks. Either positive, negative, or neutral.

| **Armor Type**  | **Slashing**  | **Piercing**  | **Bludgeoning**  |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Light           | +1            | +0            | -1               | 
| Medium          | +0            | +1            | +0               |

# <span id=Mana-System> Mana System </span>

## Spell Points

Instead of gaining spell slots to cast your spells from, you gain a pool
of spell points (referred to as **Mana**). The amount of mana you spend
is based on the level of the spell being cast, and you can't reduce your
mana pool to less than 0. You recover all spent mana when you finish a
rest, at least 6 hours. You spend mana equal to the level of spell being
cast. For example, a 1st-level spell spends 1 mana, a 9th-level spell
spends 9 mana.

The amount of mana available to spend is based on your level as a
spellcaster, as shown in the Mana Progression table below. Your level
and spellcasting attribute (wisdom/intelligence) also determines the maximum level spell you can
cast. Even though you might have enough mana to cast a spell above this
maximum, you can't do so.

## Common Magic

Spells of 1st- to 5th-level are referred to as Common magic. Common
magic spells can be cast repeatedly while enough mana remain available
to spend. For example, if you have 7 mana and can cast 2nd-level spells,
you can cast seven 1st-level spells, five 1st-level spells and one
2nd-level spells, three 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells, or
one 1st-level spell and three 2nd-level spells.

## High Magic

Spells of 6th level and higher are referred to as High magic. High magic
spells are particularly powerful. You are limited to how many high magic
spells you can cast before needing to finish a rest to cast more. The
number of high magic spells you can cast is equal to your maximum level
spell minus 5. For example, if you can cast 7th-level spells, 6th- and
7th-level spells are high magic. You can cast (7th – 5 = 2) two high
magic spells before needing a rest to recover them. They can be two
6th-level spells (total 12 mana), or one 6th- and one 7th-level spell
(total 13 mana), or two 7th-level spells (total 14 mana).

## The Five Colors Magic Paradigm

The standard schools of magic are replaced by five colors, inspired by
Magic: The Gathering's color system. Each color represents specific
magic themes and effects (referred to as aspects):

**White (W):** Bind, Disrupt, Enhance, Light, Protect, Radiance,
Suppress *(Peace, law, structure, selflessness, equality)*

**Blue (U):** Communication, Dimensions, Illusion, Knowledge, Reveal,
Time, Voyages *(Knowledge, deceit, caution, deliberation, perfection)*

**Black (B):** Acid, Coerce, Cold, Darkness, Fear, Necrotic *(Power,
self-interest, death, sacrifice, uninhibitedness)*

**Red (R):** Alter, Creation, Fire, Force, Freedom, Kinetics, Lightning
*(Freedom, emotion, action, impulse, destruction, change)*

**Green (G):** Creatures, Earth, Healing, Plants, Water, Wind *(Nature,
wildlife, connection, spirituality, tradition)*

### Mana Pool

In this system, each mana point in your pool corresponds to a specific
color. For example, a 4th-level cleric with 12 mana could allocate these
points as follows: 3W, 2U, 2B, 5G. Spells require mana of their assigned
color. For instance, a 13th-level sorcerer casting 'Etherealness' (a
Blue spell) as a 7th-level spell would spend 7 Blue mana. Mana from
other colors cannot be used.

### Devoting Mana to Colors

After a day's rest, you can redistribute your mana across the colors as
needed. For example, a 4th-level Law Mage with 12 mana may allocate the
points as 3W, 2U, 2B, 5G expecting to cast healing spells (Green)
frequently. After the next rest, the Law Mage could adjust this to 1W,
1U, 1B, and 2G based on the group's need.
